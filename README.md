# Burger Builder Application

One of the first app's I developed using React JS :) 

On the homepage user can customize a Burger with Meat, Bacon, Cheese and Salad.
On adding the ingrdeients the Burger layout and price changes and user can place order.

User can login with Google or using a combination of EmailID and Password. Once logged In user
can check out his previous order as well.
